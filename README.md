## Processing NSC File
Note, to interact with Salesforce, you'll need to create a file in the
main directory named 'salesforce_secrets.py' that has the following
three lines defining string variables:

```python
SF_LIVE_USERNAME = 'your_username'
SF_LIVE_PASSWORD = 'your_password'
SF_LIVE_TOKEN = 'your_token'
```
